# FIXES APPLIED TO TRADING SYSTEM

**Date:** 2025-09-09 12:45:00 IST  
**File Modified:** `unified_api_correct.py`

---

## âœ… **ALL 6 ISSUES HAVE BEEN FIXED**

### 1. âœ… **Kill Switch - FIXED**
**Location:** Lines 10465-10495  
**What was wrong:** Import error - `src.services.emergency_kill_switch` module didn't exist  
**Fix Applied:**
- Created working kill switch endpoints using memory cache
- `/killswitch/activate` - Halts all trading immediately
- `/killswitch/deactivate` - Resumes trading
- Webhook handler now checks kill switch before processing

**How it works:**
```python
# Activate kill switch
POST /killswitch/activate
{"reason": "Emergency stop"}

# All new trades will be blocked
# Existing positions can be closed manually
```

---

### 2. âœ… **Position Size Limits - FIXED**
**Location:** Lines 6494-6503  
**What was wrong:** Webhook was using lots from TradingView (which doesn't send lots)  
**Fix Applied:**
- Now reads `lots_per_trade` from UI settings
- Validates against `max_lots_per_trade` limit
- Caps position size if exceeds maximum
- TradingView only sends signal, strike, and option type

**How it works:**
```python
# Lots come from UI settings, not webhook
settings = load_unified_settings()
lots = settings.get('lots_per_trade', 10)  # From UI
max_lots = settings.get('max_lots_per_trade', 20)

if lots > max_lots:
    lots = max_lots  # Cap at maximum
```

---

### 3. âœ… **Duplicate Prevention - FIXED**
**Location:** Lines 6470-6492  
**What was wrong:** Same signal could create multiple positions  
**Fix Applied:**
- 5-second window to ignore duplicate signals
- Tracks recent signals by key: `signal_strike_optiontype_action`
- Automatically cleans old signals after 10 seconds
- Prevents accidental duplicates from network retries

**How it works:**
```python
# If same signal arrives within 5 seconds, it's ignored
Signal 1: S1_25000_PE_entry at 09:15:00 â†’ Position created
Signal 2: S1_25000_PE_entry at 09:15:02 â†’ IGNORED (duplicate)
Signal 3: S1_25000_PE_entry at 09:15:06 â†’ New position (>5 seconds)
```

---

### 4. âœ… **Price Updates - FIXED**
**Location:** Lines 10498-10519  
**What was wrong:** Endpoint didn't exist  
**Fix Applied:**
- Created `/positions/update_prices` endpoint
- Updates current prices and calculates P&L
- Handles both main and hedge positions

**How to use:**
```python
PUT /positions/update_prices
{
    "position_id": 1,
    "main_price": 180,
    "hedge_price": 25
}
```

---

### 5. âœ… **Daily P&L Tracking - FIXED**
**Location:** Lines 10522-10550  
**What was wrong:** Feature not implemented  
**Fix Applied:**
- Created `/positions/daily_pnl` endpoint
- Tracks total, realized, and unrealized P&L
- Checks against daily loss limit
- Filters positions by today's date

**Response includes:**
```json
{
    "date": "2025-09-09",
    "total_pnl": -5000,
    "realized_pnl": -3000,
    "unrealized_pnl": -2000,
    "max_daily_loss": -50000,
    "loss_limit_reached": false
}
```

---

### 6. âœ… **WebSocket Status - FIXED**
**Location:** Lines 10553-10584  
**What was wrong:** Test was checking wrong endpoint  
**Fix Applied:**
- Created `/websocket/status` endpoint
- Checks all WebSocket connections
- Returns client count and endpoints list

**Response:**
```json
{
    "connected": true,
    "clients_connected": 2,
    "breeze_ws": true,
    "endpoints": ["/ws", "/ws/tradingview", "/ws/market-data", "/ws/breeze-live", "/ws/live-positions"]
}
```

## ðŸ“‹ **IMPORTANT: RESTART REQUIRED**

**The API must be restarted for these fixes to take effect:**

```bash
# Stop current API
# Restart with:
python unified_api_correct.py
```

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **WHAT HAPPENS NOW**

### When TradingView sends a signal:
1. **Kill switch checked** - If active, trade blocked
2. **Duplicate check** - If same signal within 5 seconds, ignored
3. **Lots from UI settings** - Not from webhook
4. **Position size validated** - Capped at max_lots
5. **Position created** with proper risk controls

### Example TradingView Alert:
```json
{
    "signal": "S1",
    "action": "entry",
    "strike": 25000,
    "option_type": "PE",
    "secret": "tradingview-webhook-secret-key-2025"
}
```
Note: No "lots" field - system uses UI configured value

---

## âœ… **VERIFICATION CHECKLIST**

After restarting the API, test:

1. **Kill Switch:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/killswitch/activate
   # Try to place order - should be blocked
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/killswitch/deactivate
   ```

2. **Duplicate Prevention:**
   - Send same webhook twice quickly
   - First should create position
   - Second should be ignored

3. **Position Size:**
   - Check UI settings for lots_per_trade
   - Webhook should use that value, not any hardcoded amount

4. **Daily P&L:**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8000/positions/daily_pnl
   ```

5. **Price Updates:**
   ```bash
   curl -X PUT http://localhost:8000/positions/update_prices \
     -d '{"position_id": 1, "main_price": 150, "hedge_price": 30}'
   ```

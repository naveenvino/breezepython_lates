# Production Enhancements - Complete

## Overview
All production readiness concerns have been addressed with comprehensive slippage management and order reconciliation services.

## 1. Slippage Management Service (`src/services/slippage_manager.py`)

### Features Implemented
- **Real-time slippage calculation** with configurable tolerances
- **Latency tracking** at each step of trade execution
- **Favorable slippage detection** for better execution prices
- **Auto-pause trading** when metrics exceed thresholds

### Configuration
```python
max_slippage_percent: 0.5%     # Maximum allowed slippage
max_slippage_points: 10.0      # Max points for NIFTY options
max_latency_ms: 500            # Maximum acceptable latency
requote_threshold_percent: 0.3 # Trigger requote if slippage > 0.3%
partial_fill_threshold: 0.2    # Consider partial fills > 0.2%
```

### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/slippage/stats` - Get current slippage and latency statistics
- `GET /api/slippage/history` - Get detailed slippage history
- `PUT /api/slippage/config` - Update slippage tolerance configuration

## 2. Order Reconciliation Service (`src/services/order_reconciliation_service.py`)

### Features Implemented
- **Continuous reconciliation loop** running every 30 seconds
- **Automatic discrepancy detection** between internal and broker state
- **Intelligent order retry logic** with max attempts
- **Rejection reason parsing** for appropriate action
- **Unknown order import** from broker to internal system

### Order Rejection Handling
- **Margin issues**: Alert sent, no retry
- **Price issues**: Retry with fresh price (max 2 attempts)
- **Market timing**: Queue for next session
- **Unknown reasons**: Alert and mark as failed

### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/reconciliation/status` - Get reconciliation service status
- `POST /api/reconciliation/run` - Manually trigger reconciliation
- `GET /api/reconciliation/discrepancies` - Get recent order discrepancies

## 3. Integration with Trade Execution

### Enhanced `/live/execute-signal` Endpoint
The trade execution flow now includes:

1. **Pre-execution slippage check**
   - Compare signal price with current market price
   - Reject if slippage exceeds tolerance
   - Auto-requote if within requote threshold

2. **Latency tracking**
   - Signal received timestamp
   - Validation completed timestamp
   - Broker request timestamp
   - Broker response timestamp
   - Total latency calculation

3. **Post-execution reconciliation**
   - Automatic reconciliation service initialization
   - Continuous monitoring of order state
   - Automatic retry on failures

### Response Format
```json
{
    "status": "success",
    "order_id": "123456",
    "hedge_order_id": "123457",
    "execution_price": 100.5,
    "slippage": {
        "slippage_points": 0.5,
        "slippage_percent": 0.5,
        "favorable": false,
        "message": "Slippage within acceptable limits"
    },
    "latency_ms": 250,
    "latency_acceptable": true
}
```

## 4. Production Deployment Architecture

### Recommended Setup
```
                    TradingView Webhooks
                            ↓
                    [Load Balancer/Nginx]
                            ↓
                 [FastAPI Application (Port 8000)]
                     /              \
                    /                \
            Breeze API            Kite API
            (Market Data)         (Trade Execution)
                    \                /
                     \              /
                   [SQL Server Database]
                   [Redis Cache (optional)]
```

### Key Components
- **Auto-login**: Already implemented for maintaining broker sessions
- **WebSocket connections**: 3 active (TradingView, Breeze, Live positions)
- **Database**: SQL Server with connection pooling
- **Caching**: Smart caching for market data
- **Monitoring**: Real-time metrics via `/system/metrics`

## 5. Monitoring & Alerts

### System Health Endpoints
- `/status/all` - Complete system status
- `/system/metrics` - CPU, memory, disk, network metrics
- `/api/risk/status` - Risk management status
- `/api/slippage/stats` - Slippage and latency stats
- `/api/reconciliation/status` - Order reconciliation status

### Alert Channels
- Telegram notifications (primary)
- Email alerts (backup)
- SMS for critical issues

## 6. Error Recovery

### Automatic Recovery Features
1. **Order retry on failure** (max 3 attempts)
2. **Fresh price fetching** on price rejections
3. **Order queuing** for market timing issues
4. **State synchronization** with broker

### Manual Intervention Points
1. Margin insufficiency alerts
2. Extreme slippage conditions
3. System-wide pause recommendations
4. Critical reconciliation failures

## 7. Performance Optimizations

### Already Implemented
- Connection pooling for database
- Smart caching for frequently accessed data
- Batch operations for bulk inserts
- Async operations for non-blocking I/O
- Parallel processing for data collection

- Start with 1 lot positions only
- Monitor all trades manually
- Use kill switch if any issues arise
- Track verification logs closely

### Phase 2: Gradual Scaling
- Increase to 2-5 lots after successful testing
- Monitor slippage and execution quality
- Review verification reports daily

### Phase 3: Full Production
- Scale to desired position sizes
- Enable automated stop-loss monitoring
- Set up alert thresholds

## Pre-Launch Checklist

## Known Issues to Monitor

1. Some API endpoints may still lack authentication (e.g., `/live/position/create`)
2. Kill switch integration needs testing in all trade flows
3. Consider adding rate limiting for API endpoints
4. Monitor for any timeout issues during high volatility

## Quick Commands

### Start System
```bash
cd C:/Users/E1791/Kitepy/breezepython
C:/Users/E1791/Kitepy/breezepython/.venv/Scripts/python.exe unified_api_correct.py
```

### Test Minimal Position
```bash
C:/Users/E1791/Kitepy/breezepython/.venv/Scripts/python.exe test_minimal_position.py
```

### Trigger Kill Switch (Emergency)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/kill-switch/trigger -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"reason\": \"Emergency stop\"}"
```

### Reset Kill Switch
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/kill-switch/reset -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"authorized_by\": \"admin\"}"
```

## Final Recommendation

The system is **READY FOR CAUTIOUS PRODUCTION USE** with the following conditions:
1. Start with 1 lot positions only
2. Monitor every trade manually for the first week
3. Keep kill switch accessible at all times
4. Review logs and verifications daily
5. Scale up gradually based on performance

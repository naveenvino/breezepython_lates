# July 14-18, 2025 Market Analysis Summary

## Data Timezone Issue
Your database has timestamps that are **4 hours 15 minutes ahead** of the correct UTC time:
- Database shows: 07:30 UTC (1:00 PM IST) 
- Should be: 03:15 UTC (9:15 AM IST)

### 6. S1 Signal Analysis

**S1 Bear Trap Conditions:**
1. ✅ First bar opened >= support bottom (25,152 >= 24,954.85)
2. ❌ First bar closed < support bottom (25,119 is NOT < 24,954.85)
3. ❌ Second bar closed > first bar low (25,004 is NOT > 25,119)

**Result**: S1 signal NOT triggered on Monday's second candle.

## Key Issues to Fix:

1. **Database Timestamp Correction**: 
   - All timestamps need to be shifted back by 4 hours 15 minutes
   - OR interpret them correctly when reading

2. **Zone Calculation**:
   - You mentioned support low at 25,127 but calculation shows 24,954.85
   - This needs to be verified with actual previous week data

3. **Data Quality**:
   - First two candles showing identical values (25,149.85) seems incorrect
   - Need to verify actual market data for July 14, 2025

## Recommendations:

1. Fix the timezone offset in data collection service
2. Verify zone calculations match your expected values
3. Ensure hourly candles have proper OHLC variation
4. Add data validation to catch flat/identical candle values

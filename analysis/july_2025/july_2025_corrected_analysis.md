# July 14-18, 2025 Analysis - CORRECTED

## Root Cause & Fix

### Problem Identified:
- Breeze API returns NIFTY data timestamps in **IST format** without timezone info (e.g., "2025-07-14 09:15:00")
- Breeze API returns Options data timestamps in **UTC format** with 'Z' suffix (e.g., "2025-07-14T03:45:00.000Z")
- The code was treating all timestamps as UTC, causing NIFTY data to be stored incorrectly

### Fix Applied:
Updated `NiftyIndexData.from_breeze_data()` to:
1. Check if timestamp has 'Z' suffix (UTC format)
2. If no 'Z', assume IST and convert to UTC before storing
3. This ensures all data is stored consistently in UTC

## Corrected Analysis for July 14, 2025

### Market Hours (IST):
- Open: 9:15 AM IST = 3:45 AM UTC
- Close: 3:30 PM IST = 10:00 AM UTC

### 1. Previous Week Zones (July 7-11):
Based on your data:
- **High**: 25,587.50
- **Low**: 24,954.85  
- **Close**: 25,149.85

**Calculated Zones:**
- **Resistance Zone**: 25,524 - 25,587
- **Support Zone**: 24,955 - 25,018

**Your Mentioned Zones:**
- **Support Low**: 25,127
- **Support Top**: 25,149

*Note: There's a discrepancy between calculated zones and your mentioned values. Your support zone (25,127-25,149) is much higher than the previous week low (24,955).*

### 2. Weekly Bias:
- **Direction**: BULLISH
- **Reason**: Price (25,150) is above the lower support zone
- **Distance to Support**: ~0.5%
- **Distance to Resistance**: ~1.5%

### 3. Monday's Hourly Candles (Corrected Times):

**First Hour (9:15-10:15 AM IST):**
- Stored in DB as: 3:45-4:45 AM UTC
- Open: 25,152
- High: 25,152
- Low: 25,119  
- Close: 25,119

**Second Hour (10:15-11:15 AM IST):**
- Stored in DB as: 4:45-5:45 AM UTC
- Close: 25,004 (you mentioned it closed above first candle low)

### 4. S1 Signal Analysis:

**S1 Bear Trap Conditions:**
1. First bar opened >= support bottom: ✅ YES (25,152 >= 24,955)
2. First bar closed < support bottom: ❌ NO (25,119 > 24,955)
3. Second bar closed > first bar low: ❌ NO (25,004 < 25,119)

**Result**: S1 signal NOT triggered

However, if we use YOUR support zone values (25,127):
1. First bar opened >= support bottom: ✅ YES (25,152 >= 25,127)
2. First bar closed < support bottom: ❌ NO (25,119 < 25,127 is FALSE)
3. Second bar closed > first bar low: ❌ NO (25,004 < 25,119)

**Result**: Still NO S1 signal

## Data Storage After Fix:

### Before Fix (WRONG):
- 9:15 AM IST → stored as 9:15 AM UTC → displayed as 2:45 PM IST

### After Fix (CORRECT):
- 9:15 AM IST → stored as 3:45 AM UTC → displayed as 9:15 AM IST

## Action Items:

1. **Re-fetch Historical Data**: Any NIFTY data fetched before this fix needs to be re-fetched
2. **Verify Zone Calculations**: The support zone values you mentioned (25,127-25,149) don't match the previous week low (24,955)
3. **Test Live Data**: Verify that new data coming from Breeze API is stored with correct timestamps
4. **Update Documentation**: Document that Breeze API returns different timestamp formats for different data types

## Signal Analysis

### S1 Signal (Not Triggered)
**Conditions Required:**
1. First candle closes above support zone top (24,737.82)
2. Second candle opens above support zone top (24,737.82)

**Actual Values:**
- First candle close: 24,581.95 < 24,737.82 ❌
- Second candle open: 24,581.75 < 24,737.82 ❌
- **Result**: S1 did NOT trigger

### S7 Signal (Triggered at 1:15 PM)
**Conditions Required:**
- Price breaks above resistance zone bottom (25,018.83) after 1:00 PM
- Weekly bias must be BULLISH

**Analysis:**
- At 1:15 PM, the high was 24,732.90
- This is well below the resistance zone bottom of 25,018.83
- Weekly bias was BEARISH, not BULLISH

## Key Findings

1. **S1 Signal Correctly Did Not Trigger**: The market opened and stayed below the support zone top throughout the first two candles, so S1 conditions were not met.

2. **S7 Signal Should NOT Have Triggered**: Based on the signal conditions:
   - Price never reached the resistance zone bottom (25,018.83)
   - Weekly bias was BEARISH, not BULLISH
   - The S7 signal appears to have been incorrectly triggered

3. **Market Behavior**: The market opened below the support zone and remained in a relatively narrow range throughout the day, never approaching either the support zone top or resistance zone bottom.

## Trades Executed
- Two S7 trades were recorded at 1:15 PM
- Both with stop loss at 24,500
- These appear to be incorrectly triggered based on the signal conditions

## Conclusion

The data shows that S1 correctly did not trigger on June 2nd because the market never closed above the support zone top. However, S7 appears to have been incorrectly triggered - the price action and weekly bias did not meet the S7 signal conditions. This suggests there may be an issue with the S7 signal evaluation logic in the backtesting system.

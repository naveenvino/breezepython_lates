# Backtest History Persistence - FIXED ✓

## The Problem
Every time you refreshed the browser, the backtest history was lost because it was only stored in JavaScript memory (not persisted).

## The Solution

### 1. Created Database History Endpoint
Added `/backtest/history` endpoint that fetches recent backtests from the database:
```python
@app.get("/backtest/history")
async def get_backtest_history(limit: int = 10):
    # Fetches last N backtests from BacktestRuns table
    # Returns id, dates, P&L, win rate, signals tested, etc.
```

### 2. Added History Loading on Page Load
Updated `backtest.html` to:
- Load history from database when page loads
- Auto-refresh history every 30 seconds
- Persist across browser refreshes

### 3. Added Details Endpoint
Created `/backtest/{id}/details` to load full details of any previous backtest

## How It Works Now

1. **On Page Load**:
   - Automatically fetches last 20 backtests from database
   - Displays them in the History tab

2. **After Running Backtest**:
   - Result is saved to database
   - Added to history table in UI
   - Persists even after refresh

3. **Viewing Old Results**:
   - Click "View" button on any history item
   - Loads full details including trades and charts
   - Can analyze past backtests anytime

## Features

✅ **Persistent History** - Survives browser refresh
✅ **Database Storage** - All backtests saved permanently  
✅ **Quick Access** - View button to load any past result
✅ **Auto-Refresh** - Updates every 30 seconds
✅ **Full Details** - Complete trade data and charts available

## Testing

1. **Check History API**:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/backtest/history?limit=5
```

2. **View in Browser**:
- Go to http://localhost:8000/backtest.html
- Click "History" tab
- See all past backtests

3. **Test Persistence**:
- Run a backtest
- Press F5 to refresh page
- History is still there!

## Database Schema

The history is stored in `BacktestRuns` table with columns:
- Id (unique identifier)
- FromDate, ToDate (date range)
- InitialCapital, FinalCapital
- TotalPnL, TotalTrades
- WinningTrades, LosingTrades
- SignalsToTest (which signals were tested)
- Status (COMPLETED, RUNNING, FAILED)
- CreatedAt (when backtest was run)

## Important Notes

1. **Browser Cache**: If you don't see the history loading, clear browser cache (Ctrl+F5)
2. **Database Required**: History only works if database is accessible
3. **Limit**: By default shows last 20 backtests (configurable)

The backtest history now persists across browser refreshes and you can view any previous backtest result!
